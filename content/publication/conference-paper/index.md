abstract: Occupational prestige (OP) is the psychological component of objective socioeconomic status (SES) that represents individual differences in the amount of status conferred to individuals based on their occupation. It is unlike other “objective” measures of SES (income and educational attainment) in that it is not factual information but instead an indirectly measured latent construct. In this work, we collected 150,000+ prestige ratings of ~1000 `O*NET` (the U.S.’s primary repository of job information) occupations (M = 153). We estimated agreement among the people who rated each occupation to assess reliability and show consensus. To compare our ratings to related measures we created crosswalks, that match corresponding occupations, and estimated the correlations between them. The correlations between OP and income and educational attainment showed convergent and discriminate validity. To connect OP to real-world job skills and requirements, we used a statistical learning approach to identify the physiological and psychological characteristics associated with prestige using data collected by `O*NET`, containing ratings of 250 characteristics of each occupation. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We collected 150,000+ prestige ratings of ~1000 O*NET occupations (M = 153). We show consensus in these ratings of occupational prestige (OP) and present correlations with related measures. Correlations with income and education show convergent and discriminate validity. We use statistical learning to identify the physiological and psychological characteristics of occupations associated with OP.
