I am a professor emerit of psychology at the University of Oregon. I study how personality, emotions, status, and culture are expressed in social interactions and online, how people form impressions of one another, and how personality develops over the lifespan. I am also interested in methods and practices in psychology that make the field more open, rigorous, inclusive, and just. I teach, blog, and podcast about personality psychology, open science, and research methods.
