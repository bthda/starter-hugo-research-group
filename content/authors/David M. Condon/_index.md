My work is particularly focused on questions related to the structure and measurement of psychological individual differences (e.g., temperament/personality, cognitive abilities, interests, values, motivation). This work includes the development of measurement tools for use in clinical settings and the translation of findings from individual differences research towards the prediction of real-world outcomes. Most of this work follows from analyses of large-scale data sets like those collected from the SAPA-Project, where data on more than 7,000 variables are contributed by over 250,000 participants each year. Datasets like these are well-suited for the development of both empirically-informed outcome-specific prediction tools and taxonomic models that can more broadly inform the ways that individual differences relate to one another across the lifespan.
